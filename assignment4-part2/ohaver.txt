Checked in/out buttons working. Spent a TON of time trying to figure out how to a) create a dropdown menu with PHP and b) filter the output by that dropdown menu. Eventually succeeded. Revisited Piazza and found additional error handling that was needed, implemented that. Scrapped CSS because after 12 hours, there are bigger fish to fry.
