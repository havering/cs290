Created login.php form and html code. Continued working on loopback.

Started the actual PHP for login.php, continued working on loopback. I'm having trouble with outputting anything at all inside my if statements.

Continued working on loopback. A typo in my if statement for GET took way too much time to discover as I repeatedly tried to retrieve output via GET and failed. Continued working on login.php and content1.

6:00 - 9:16

Started and finished content 2. Over an hour spent figuring out why the visits weren't incrementing in content1. Additional time spent tweaking output details to match assignment specs.
